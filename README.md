# Wearable Computing Telemetry

This repository contains a script `run_analysis.R` which processes wearable computing telemetry data and produces two output datasets `wearable_telemetry.txt` and `wearable_telemetry_mean_by_activity_subject.txt`. See [CodeBook.md](./CodeBook.md) for a description of the source data, processing, and output data.
